# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
The purpose of the cryptocurrency analysis is to use an unsupervised machine learning model, reduce the data set using principle componenent analysis, and the Kmeans clustering algorithm to cluster the crypto currencies. 

## Description
The data were preprocessed and then using principle component analysis, reduced further assuming 3 principle components. 

The currencies were then clustered using the K-Means; 4 clusters were assumed based on the outcome of the elbow curve plotting and interpretation.

The clustering was then vizualized using both 3D plot and a scatter plot of the Min/Max scaled Total Coins Mined and Total Coin Supply.
